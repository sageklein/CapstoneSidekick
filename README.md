## Proposal: 

Name of Project: Classroom Sidekick 

Brief Proposal: Sidekick is a school behavioral management and communication platform that teachers, students, and families use every day to build close-knit communities by sharing students day to day behavior in the classroom. By providing students with an Avatar, teachers will add and subtract points throughout the school day depending on the students' behavior. Good behavior reward points will be redeemable in an online store where the student can view their personal Avatar, view their behavioral points and view the store where they may redeem their points on items for their avatar, such as accessories, skin, clothing or background color changing and more.
